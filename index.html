**Privacy Policy for [Your Service Name]**

**Last Updated:** September 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Service Name] ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with our service that connects our clients' Instagram accounts with their business systems.

**1. What Our Service Does**

Our service acts as a bridge between our client's ([Client Business Name]) Instagram Direct Messages and their internal business software (ERP). The purpose is to allow the business to manage customer conversations and requests (like checking an order status) more efficiently. We provide this service to businesses; we do not have a direct relationship with the individuals ("you") messaging our clients' Instagram pages.

**2. Information We Handle**

When you send a message to one of our clients' Instagram accounts, our service processes the following information on behalf of our client:

* **Instagram User Information:** Your public Instagram ID (Sender ID) and username.
* **Message Content:** The text, images, or other content of the messages you send.

We do not collect any other personal information, such as your email address, name, or other profile details, unless you voluntarily provide it within a message.

**3. How We Use Information**

The information we process is used exclusively to:

* Deliver your message from Instagram to our client's business system.
* Deliver our client's reply from their business system back to you on Instagram.
* Enable the functionality of the automated bot (e.g., identifying an order number in your message to look up its status).

We do not use your information for our own purposes, for advertising, or for profiling. We are simply a data processor acting on the instructions of our client.

**4. Data Sharing**

We only share the information we process with the specific client you are communicating with. We do not sell, rent, or share your information with any other third parties.

**5. Data Security and Retention**

We take reasonable measures to protect the information transmitted through our service. Data is retained only as long as necessary to ensure message delivery and for troubleshooting purposes, after which it may be deleted. The ultimate responsibility for your data lies with the business you are messaging, as per their own privacy policies.

**6. Contact Us**
